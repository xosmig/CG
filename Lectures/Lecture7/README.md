## Assignment №7: Parallax Occlusion Culling

1. Download a set of Albedo, Normal Map, Height Map. For example, from [this site](https://freepbr.com/c/walls/page/2/). 
Make sure that they are steep enough to show off benefits of Parallax Occlusion Culling
2. Import them into Unity. Select `Normal Map` as a texture type for the normal map.
3. Implement Normal Mapping. Feel free to refer to [Unity Docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-VertexFragmentShaderExamples.html).
This is not the main goal of the assignment.
4. Implement Parallax Occlusion Culling. A simple regular-step version with a linear approximation in the end is enough.
5. Send me a screenshot of your results at mischapanin@gmail.com along with your code.
6. The e-mail should have the following topic: __HSE.CG.<your_name>.<your_last_name>.HW7__

**Bonus points:** 
+10% for cone mapping
+10% for soft self-shadowing
+10% for correct Per-Pixel Depth Offset
